# Examples Bots

Here are some simple bot applications that demonstrate concepts you may wish to integrate what you build.

- [Lighthouse](https://robocodejs.com/samples/lighthouse.js) A stationary bot that turns as it scans for others, then adjusting its turret for maximum accuracy before firing.

- [Magnetic](https://robocodejs.com/samples/magnetic.js) Demonstrating advanced multi-bot communication, these bots use secure communication to share their location and cluster together.

- [Pathfinder](https://robocodejs.com/samples/pathfinder.js) With a predefined set of waypoints, this bot navigates continuously around the arena.

- [Spirograph](https://robocodejs.com/samples/spirograph.js) This bot makes slow looping turns through the arena, scanning straight ahead and firing if it detects something.

- [Stately](https://robocodejs.com/samples/stately.js) Using a simple state machine, this bot shifts between different modes of operation.

- [Chronometer](https://robocodejs.com/samples/chronometer.js) This bot demonstrates the use of one-shot timers and scheduled interval timers.

- [ReturnFire](https://robocodejs.com/samples/returnfire.js) Although stationary, this bot quickly turns to face any enemy bots who collide or hit it, then returns fire.
