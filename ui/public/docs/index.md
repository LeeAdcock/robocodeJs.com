# RobocodeJs

**Welcome to the arena! RobocodeJs is a browser-based programming game that teaches [functional reactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) with JavaScript. Brainstorm your own winning strategy, program your bot's artificial intelligence, and set it loose in the arena in teams to defeat your competition. Onwards to fame and glory!**

The battle arena is a square space filled with groups of bots working together as a team. Each app you program is the artificial intelligence for each member of a team. Your goal is to find and destroy your enemies before they eliminate you from the game. You'll have the use of your bot's radar and a turret mounted canon.

As you work to develop your application code, the bots in the arena will immediately adapt to the changes you make. Quickly reset the match and start a new game, or add or remove bots as you try out different iterations on your strategy.

# Getting started

To create your first bot, sign in to your Google account and use the menu to select "Apps"..."Create new application" and your new application will be created and your bots added to the arena.  Time to get coding!

You'll want to have the [documentation](/dev) on how to code your bots handy, and then walk through the tutorial below on creating your very first bot.  Once you are ready to see some other more complex examples, check out the library of [example applications](/examples) that showcase a number of different techniques that you can put to use.

## Naming your Bot

In our applications, the bots are represented by the `bot` object which has a collection of methods and properties you can use to control your bot.  For our first bot, we'll use the `setName(...)` method to provide our bot its new name. This method takes a text string as its only parameter, pick a name that will spark fear among the other bots in the arena!

```
bot.setName('My first bot')
```

Clicking the "Save" button in the editor will send your new application to all of your bots, and they will immediately execute it and start using their new logic.

## Firing the Turret

Next, let's write a JavaScript function that will fire the bot's turret, if it's loaded.  The turret takes time to reload, so you'll usually want to check its status before you try to use it.  All of the turret controls are on the `bot.turret` object.

```
function fireIfReady() {
  if(bot.turret.isReady()) {
    bot.turret.fire()
  }
}
```

To call this function and run your new turret behavior, let's attach it to an event. In this case we want to keep checking if the turret is ready to fire, so let's attach this behavior to the `clock`'s `Event.TICK` event.  The clock tick is the smallest increment of time in the arena, and ensures we'll execute this code as soon as the turret is ready.  We pass the `clock.on` method the type of event and the function we created to execute when this event happens.  You can only have one event handler defined for each event type, so if you call this again it will overwrite any other event handler you've already set.

```
clock.on(Event.TICK, fireIfReady)
```

## Movement

Now let's have our bot turn each time it fires.  This will be done by creating a new function for this behavior, and attaching it to the `Event.FIRED` event on our bot.  This follows a similar pattern to how we added our previous behavior. Angles in the arena are measured in degrees with 0Â° being directly down and increases in angle turn clockwise.

```
function turnRight() {
  bot.turn(10)  
}

bot.on(Event.FIRED, turnRight)
```

There are several other ways to define and pass functions in JavaScript, and you'll see those other ways in some of our examples. The result is the same, but different approaches may be better in different situations for helping increase your code's readability.

# Next steps!

You've created your first bot! This simple logic is probably not likely to dominate the arena, but it's a great first step as you begin to learn RobocodeJs.

Next you may want to skim through the detailed [RobocodeJs documentation](/dev), study a few [more examples](/examples), or [deepen your knowledge](https://learnjavascript.online/) on the JavaScript programming language.
